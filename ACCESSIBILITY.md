# Accessibility Features for Seniors

TapAlert is designed to be usable by everyone, including people with hearing loss, low vision, tremors, or other age-related conditions. This guide explains each accessibility feature and how to get the most out of it.

---

## 1. Large Text Support

**Who it helps:** People with low vision or difficulty reading small text.

TapAlert respects the font size you set in your phone's system settings. If you increase the text size in **Settings > Display > Font Size** (Android) or **Settings > Accessibility > Display & Text Size > Larger Text** (iOS), all text in TapAlert will grow accordingly — buttons, labels, menus, and messages.

**No action needed inside the app.** Just set your preferred font size in your phone settings and TapAlert will follow it automatically.

## 2. Screen Reader Support (TalkBack / VoiceOver)

**Who it helps:** People with severe vision impairment who use a screen reader.

TapAlert works with:
- **TalkBack** on Android (Settings > Accessibility > TalkBack)
- **VoiceOver** on iPhone (Settings > Accessibility > VoiceOver)

When a screen reader is active:
- The **SOS** and **I'm OK** buttons are announced with their names and current state (enabled or disabled).
- When you start a countdown before sending an alert, the screen reader counts down the remaining seconds aloud so you always know how long you have before the alert is sent.
- After an alert is sent, the screen reader announces **"Alert sent"** or **"Alert failed"** so you know the outcome without needing to look at the screen.

## 3. Haptic Feedback (Phone Vibration)

**Who it helps:** People with hearing loss who cannot hear the countdown sound, or anyone who prefers tactile confirmation.

TapAlert uses your phone's vibration motor to give you physical feedback at key moments:

| Moment | Vibration |
|--------|-----------|
| Countdown tick | One firm pulse per second — you can feel the countdown in your hand |
| Alert sent successfully | Three strong pulses in quick succession |
| Alert failed | Two rapid buzzes |
| Countdown cancelled | Two medium pulses — confirms you cancelled, not sent |
| No recipients configured (error) | One long vibration |

**No action needed.** Haptic feedback works automatically as long as vibration is enabled on your phone (check your phone's silent/vibration switch).

## 4. Sound Alerts

**Who it helps:** People who need to hear when an alert is sent, including those with moderate hearing loss.

When an alert is sent, TapAlert plays a sound on **your own device** to confirm the alert went out. You can customize the sound in **Settings > Notification Sound**:

- **None** — no sound
- **Plain Sounds** — simple, clear tones (good for most users)
- **Rich Sounds** — fuller, more musical tones

Within each sound style, you can also adjust:

- **Sound Pitch** — slide left for a lower, deeper tone. Lower-pitched sounds (around 500 Hz) are easier to hear for people with age-related high-frequency hearing loss. The default is already set to a lower pitch for this reason.
- **Volume** — set how loud the confirmation sound plays.

**Where to find it:** Settings → Notification Sound

## 5. Screen Flash and Torch Flash

**Who it helps:** People with hearing loss who may miss the sound, or anyone in a loud environment. Also useful when the phone is face-down or in a pocket.

When an alert is sent successfully, TapAlert produces:

1. **Screen flash** — the entire screen lights up white three times in quick succession.
2. **Torch flash** — the camera LED on the back of the phone flashes three times simultaneously, visible even when the screen faces down.

Both flashes run at the same time and complete in under one second.

**To turn this off** (for example, if you have a photosensitive condition):
Go to **Settings → Notification Sound → Flash on Alert** and switch it off.

---

## 6. Swipe to Cancel the Countdown

**Who it helps:** Anyone who accidentally starts a countdown and needs to cancel it quickly.

When you tap the SOS button, a countdown dialog appears before the alert is sent. You can cancel it in two ways:

- Tap the **Cancel** button at the bottom of the dialog.
- **Swipe the dialog left or right** — the dialog slides with your finger and dismisses when you release it far enough.

Either way, you will feel two short vibrations confirming the alert was cancelled and nothing was sent.

---

## 7. Voice Message Composition

**Who it helps:** People with tremors, arthritis, or other conditions that make typing difficult.

Instead of typing a custom message before sending an alert, you can speak it. Tap the **microphone icon** in the message field and speak your message. The app will transcribe your words automatically. Silence for 3 seconds stops recording.

This works on the home screen message input and in the dead man's timer dialog.

---

## 8. Hold-to-Send Mode

**Who it helps:** People who are prone to accidentally tapping the SOS button.

By default, the SOS button requires only a single tap. If accidental presses are a concern, you can switch to **Hold to Send** mode:

Go to **Settings → Trigger Method → Hold to Send**.

In this mode, you must press and hold the button for the full hold duration before the alert is triggered, preventing accidental sends.

---

## 9. Simple (Panic) Mode

**Who it helps:** Seniors or users who find the standard interface too complex.

TapAlert has a **Simple Mode** that shows a single large SOS button with nothing else on screen. There are no menus to navigate, no tabs, no settings to change — just one button.

This is the default mode when the app is first installed. To switch between modes:
Go to **Settings → Interface** and choose between **Simple** and **Standard**.

---

## 10. Home Screen Widget (Android)

**Who it helps:** Anyone who finds it difficult to unlock their phone and open the app in an emergency.

On Android, you can add a TapAlert widget to your home screen so the SOS button is always one tap away — without opening the app at all.

To add the widget: **Settings → Home Screen Widget → Add Widget**.
